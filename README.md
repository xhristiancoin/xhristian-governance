# XHRISTIAN Governance Records

This repository documents governance principles and stewardship intent for the $XHRISTIAN project.

It exists to provide continuity, transparency, and a public record of how the project is maintained over time.

## Formal Governance Mechanisms

This repository will document:
- Stewardship principles
- Administrative intent
- How governance-related information will be recorded publicly

No voting systems, token-based governance, or binding procedures are in place at this stage.

## Stewardship Principles

The project is maintained with the following principles in mind:
- Transparency over discretion
- Documentation over private decision-making
- Continuity beyond any single contributor

Future governance structures, if any, will be documented here if and when they are introduced.

## Scope Limitations

This repository does not define:
- Economic rights
- Ownership guarantees
- Future development commitments
